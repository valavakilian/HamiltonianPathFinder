# HamiltonianPathFinder
To run these examples run the runExample python function (it uses python 3 and some number of libraries ) and follow the instructions please.
This Repository is a basis of using methods to find all hamiltonian paths between two nodes in a graph.
Currently we use V2 HamiltonianSolver which is slightly faster than the previous version.
V3 HamiltonianPath uses dynamic programming to find the number of path and whether a path exists much faster. However, I have issues on how to actually retrieve the paths from this solution. However if there are n! paths, there isn't much of an enhancement that can be made.
